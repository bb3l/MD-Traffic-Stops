# MD Traffic Stops 

This is a project done using Maryland traffic stops data from the years 2007, 2009, and 2011-14.

I thought it would be interesting to see what it was like back then. The data has stops about different races and sexes. 

I decided to explore the data to see how the different races and sexes compared back then. 
Later on, I decided to just focus on the two races that had the highest stops count, comparing their females and males.

The stops resulted in three different outcomes, so I look at which outcome was the most common. 

The data used was from the Stanford Open Policoing Project https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ , the MD state patrol.
